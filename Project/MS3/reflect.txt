Project MS3 is the hardest workshop I ever had. I read the instruction many times to make sure that I understand what I have to include in my code. Both Workstation module and LineManager module let me get more familiar with vector and deque container, and also the STL algorithms, I have tried my best to write the STL algorithms, at first, the logic and syntax is a little bit confuse, so I wrote the for loop at the first to make my logic more clear, then try to rewrite them by STL algorithms. Like the code I provide below,

find the first station
Before,
for (size_t i = 0u; i < activeLine.size(); i++) {
			size_t count = 0u;
			for (size_t j = 0u; j < activeLine.size(); j++) {
				if ((activeLine[j]->getNextStation() != nullptr) && (activeLine[i]->getItemName() == activeLine[j]->getNextStation()->getItemName())){
					count++;
					j = activeLine.size();
				}	
			}
			if (count == 0u) {
				m_firstStation = activeLine[i];
				i = activeLine.size();
			}
		};

After:
		vector<Workstation*> activeLine1(activeLine);
		m_firstStation = *find_if_not(activeLine1.begin(), activeLine1.end(), [activeLine1](const Workstation* ws1)
			{
				return any_of(activeLine1.begin(), activeLine1.end(), [ws1](const Workstation* ws2) {
					return ws1 == ws2->getNextStation(); });
			});

For all the workshop and the Project, is there any possibility that the professor posts their code to the students so that we can learn how a mature programmer write the code?
