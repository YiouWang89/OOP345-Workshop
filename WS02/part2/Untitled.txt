Workshop2, is about copy constructor, copy assignment operator and move constructor, move assignment operator. I learn the copy constructor and copy assignment operator last semester in OOP244, and I thought that the move constructor and move assignment operator are very similar to the copy one. After this workshop, it shows me the significant difference between copy and move. It seems like when using a copy constructor or copy assignment operator, it copies the same content into two different instances, so it takes double memory from the system and also it takes lots of times to copy that. The move does a different action, it changes the pointer to the original one, and no need to copy the same content, so it only takes a litter time just for the pointer to change the address.

For this workshop, I feel that I didn't have trouble on copy and move semantics, but only need time to understand how the "std::chrono::steady_clock::time_point" worked, I read the link in the instruction for several times to make it clear to me.
